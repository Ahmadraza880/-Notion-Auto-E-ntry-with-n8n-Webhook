# üìÑ Notion Auto-Entry with n8n Webhook

A robust automation solution for inserting structured data into a **Notion database** using **n8n** Webhooks. This project streamlines task and contact management by connecting external inputs (e.g., forms, Postman, or APIs) to Notion with dynamic data formatting.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Webhook-Driven Input**: Accepts structured JSON data from external sources like Postman, forms, or APIs.
- **Dynamic Data Formatting**: Uses n8n's Function node to transform input into Notion‚Äôs strict database structure.
- **Notion Integration**: Creates rows in a Notion database with support for `title`, `rich_text`, `select`, and `date` fields.
- **Batch Support**: Handles single or multiple entries via array-based JSON payloads.
- **Flexible Use Cases**: Ideal for logging tasks, leads, contacts, or form submissions directly into Notion.

---

## üß© Tech Stack

- **n8n**: Open-source, self-hosted workflow automation platform.
- **Notion API**: For seamless database interaction and row creation.
- **Webhook Trigger**: Captures JSON input from external tools or apps.
- **JavaScript (Function Node)**: Dynamically formats input to match Notion‚Äôs schema.

## üì• Sample JSON Input

Below is an example JSON payload to send via Postman or other tools:

```json
{
  "Employee Name": "Saad Tahir",
  "Department": "Automation",
  "Current Project": "CRM Integration",
  "Progress Status": "Responded",
  "Deadline": "2025-08-10",
  "Notes": "Webhook automation test"
}
```

For batch processing, send an array:

```json
[
  {
    "Employee Name": "Saad Tahir",
    "Department": "Automation",
    "Current Project": "CRM Integration",
    "Progress Status": "Responded",
    "Deadline": "2025-08-10",
    "Notes": "Webhook automation test"
  },
  {
    "Employee Name": "Ayesha Khan",
    "Department": "Marketing",
    "Current Project": "Campaign Launch",
    "Progress Status": "In Progress",
    "Deadline": "2025-08-15",
    "Notes": "Social media integration"
  }
]
```

## üîÅ Workflow Overview

1. **Webhook Trigger**: Receives JSON input from external sources.
2. **Function Node**: Transforms raw input into Notion-compatible format.
3. **Notion Node**: Inserts formatted data as a new row in the specified Notion database.
4. **Output**: Confirms successful entry with a response or logs errors for debugging.

---

## üß™ Use Cases

- **Form Integration**: Send Typeform, Tally, or custom form submissions directly to Notion.
- **CRM Automation**: Log leads, tasks, or contacts from tools like HubSpot or Salesforce.
- **Task Management**: Automate task logging from Telegram, Slack, or other apps.
- **Replace Legacy Workflows**: Swap Google Sheets + Zapier with a lightweight, custom n8n solution.
